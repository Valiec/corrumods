## unityfix.js

Just fixes the unity counter not incrementing so that the Moth dialogue can appear.

## groundsmind.js

This is the beginnings of a modding library for corru.observer.

It currently supports:

* Custom pages (both fetched from URLs and hardcoded into the JS)
* Registering actors and dialogues through JS

Look at the comments in https://valiec.github.io/corrumods/demo/demo.js for a simple example ("hi vekoa" memory hole entry)
